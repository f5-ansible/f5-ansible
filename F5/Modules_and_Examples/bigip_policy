- name: Manage general policy configuration on a BIG-IP
  bigip_policy:
      description:           # The description to attach to the policy. This parameter is only supported on versions of BIG-IP >= 12.1.0. On earlier versions it will simply be ignored.
      name:                  # (required) The name of the policy to create.
      partition:             # Device partition to manage resources on.
      password:              # (required) The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
      provider:              # A dict object containing connection details.
      rules:                 # Specifies a list of rules that you want associated with this policy. The order of this list is the order they will be evaluated by BIG-IP. If the specified rules do not exist (for example when
                               creating a new policy) then they will be created. The `conditions' for a default rule are `all'. The `actions' for a default rule are `ignore'. The `bigip_policy_rule'
                               module can be used to create and edit existing and new rules.
      server:                # (required) The BIG-IP host. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.
      server_port:           # The BIG-IP server port. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
      state:                 # When `state' is `present', ensures that the policy exists and is published. When `state' is `absent', ensures that the policy is removed, even if it is currently drafted. When `state' is `draft',
                               ensures that the policy exists and is drafted. When modifying rules, it is required that policies first be in a draft. Drafting is only supported on versions of BIG-IP
                               >= 12.1.0. On versions prior to that, specifying a `state' of `draft' will raise an error.
      strategy:              # Specifies the method to determine which actions get executed in the case where there are multiple rules that match. When creating new policies, the default is `first'. This module does not allow you
                               to specify the `best' strategy to use. It will choose the system default (`/Common/best-match') for you instead.
      user:                  # (required) The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.
      validate_certs:        # If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable
                               `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
