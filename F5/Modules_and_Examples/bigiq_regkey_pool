  bigiq_regkey_pool:
      description:           # A description to attach to the pool.
      name:                  # (required) Specifies the name of the registration key pool. You must be mindful to name your registration pools unique names. While BIG-IQ does not require this, this module does. If you do not do
                               this, the behavior of the module is undefined and you may end up putting licenses in the wrong registration key pool.
      password:              # (required) The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
      provider:              # A dict object containing connection details.
      server:                # (required) The BIG-IP host. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.
      server_port:           # The BIG-IP server port. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
      state:                 # The state of the regkey pool on the system. When `present', guarantees that the pool exists. When `absent', removes the pool, and the licenses it contains, from the system.
      user:                  # (required) The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.
      validate_certs:        # If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable
                               `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
