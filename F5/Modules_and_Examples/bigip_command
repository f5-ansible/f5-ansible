  bigip_command:
      chdir:                 # Change into this directory before running the command.
      commands:              # (required) The commands to send to the remote BIG-IP device over the configured provider. The resulting output from the command is returned. If the `wait_for' argument is provided, the module is not
                               returned until the condition is satisfied or the number of retries as expired. Only `tmsh' commands are supported. If you are piping or adding additional logic that is
                               outside of `tmsh' (such as grep'ing, awk'ing or other shell related things that are not `tmsh', this behavior is not supported.
      interval:              # Configures the interval in seconds to wait between retries of the command. If the command does not pass the specified conditional, the interval indicates how to long to wait before trying the command
                               again.
      match:                 # The `match' argument is used in conjunction with the `wait_for' argument to specify the match policy. Valid values are `all' or `any'. If the value is set to `all' then all conditionals in the
                               `wait_for' must be satisfied. If the value is set to `any' then only one of the values must be satisfied.
      password:              # (required) The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
      provider:              # A dict object containing connection details.
      retries:               # Specifies the number of retries a command should by tried before it is considered failed. The command is run on the target device every retry and evaluated against the `wait_for' conditionals.
      server:                # (required) The BIG-IP host. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.
      server_port:           # The BIG-IP server port. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
      transport:             # (required) Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device. The transport argument supports connectivity to the device over cli (ssh) or rest.
      user:                  # (required) The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.
      validate_certs:        # If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable
                               `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
      wait_for:              # Specifies what to evaluate from the output of the command and what conditionals to apply.  This argument will cause the task to wait for a particular conditional to be true before moving forward. If
                               the conditional is not true by the configured retries, the task fails. See examples.
      warn:                  # Whether the module should raise warnings related to command idempotency or not. Note that the F5 Ansible developers specifically leave this on to make you aware that your usage of this module may be
                               better served by official F5 Ansible modules. This module should always be used as a last resort.
