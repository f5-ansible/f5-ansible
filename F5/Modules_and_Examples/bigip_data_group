- name: Manage data groups on a BIG-IP
  bigip_data_group:
      delete_data_group_file:   # When `yes', will ensure that the remote data group file is deleted. This parameter is only relevant when `state' is `absent' and `internal' is `no'.
      external_file_name:    # When creating a new data group, this specifies the file name that you want to give an external data group file on the BIG-IP. This parameter is ignored when `internal' is `yes'. This parameter can be
                               used to select an existing data group file to use with an existing external data group. If this value is not provided, it will be given the value specified in `name'
                               and, therefore, match the name of the data group. This value may only contain letters, numbers, underscores, dashes, or a period.
      internal:              # The type of this data group. You should only consider setting this value in cases where you know exactly what you're doing, *or*, you are working with a pre-existing internal data group. Be aware that
                               if you deliberately force this parameter to `yes', and you have a either a large number of records or a large total records size, this large amount of data will be
                               reflected in your BIG-IP configuration. This can lead to *long* system configuration load times due to needing to parse and verify the large configuration. There is a
                               limit of either 4 megabytes or 65,000 records (whichever is more restrictive) for uploads when this parameter is `yes'. This value cannot be changed once the data group
                               is created.
      name:                  # (required) Specifies the name of the data group.
      partition:             # Device partition to manage resources on.
      password:              # (required) The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
      provider:              # A dict object containing connection details.
      records:               # Specifies the records that you want to add to a data group. If you have a large number of records, it is recommended that you use `records_content' instead of typing all those records here. The
                               technical limit of either 1. the number of records, or 2. the total size of all records, varies with the size of the total resources on your system; in particular, RAM.
                               When `internal' is `no', at least one record must be specified in either `records' or `records_content'.
      records_src:           # Path to a file with records in it. The file should be well-formed. This means that it includes records, one per line, that resemble the following format "key separator value". For example, `foo :=
                               bar'. BIG-IP is strict about this format, but this module is a bit more lax. It will allow you to include arbitrary amounts (including none) of empty space on either
                               side of the separator. For an illustration of this, see the Examples section. Record keys are limited in length to no more than 65520 characters. Values of record keys
                               are limited in length to no more than 65520 characters. The total number of records you can have in your BIG-IP is limited by the memory of the BIG-IP. The format of
                               this content is slightly different depending on whether you specify a `type' of `address', `integer', or `string'. See the examples section for examples of the different
                               types of payload formats that are expected in your data group file. When `internal' is `no', at least one record must be specified in either `records' or
                               `records_content'.
      separator:             # When specifying `records_content', this is the string of characters that will be used to break apart entries in the `records_content' into key/value pairs. By default, this parameter's value is `:='.
                               This value cannot be changed once it is set. This parameter is only relevant when `internal' is `no'. It will be ignored otherwise.
      server:                # (required) The BIG-IP host. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.
      server_port:           # The BIG-IP server port. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
      state:                 # When `state' is `present', ensures the data group exists. When `state' is `absent', ensures that the data group is removed.
      type:                  # The type of records in this data group. This parameter is especially important because it causes BIG-IP to store your data in different ways so-as to optimize access to it. For example, it would be
                               wrong to specify a list of records containing IP addresses, but label them as a `string' type. This value cannot be changed once the data group is created.
      user:                  # (required) The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.
      validate_certs:        # If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable
                               `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
