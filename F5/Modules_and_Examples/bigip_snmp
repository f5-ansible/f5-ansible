      agent_authentication_traps:   # When `enabled', ensures that the system sends authentication warning traps to the trap destinations. This is usually disabled by default on a BIG-IP.

      allowed_addresses:     # Configures the IP addresses of the SNMP clients from which the snmpd daemon accepts requests. This value can be hostnames, IP addresses, or IP networks. You may specify a single list item of `default'
                               to set the value back to the system's default of `127.0.0.0/8'. You can remove all allowed addresses by either providing the word `none', or by providing the empty
                               string `""'.
