- name: Manages F5 BIG-IP GTM servers
  bigip_gtm_server:
      datacenter:            # Data center the server belongs to. When creating a new GTM server, this value is required.
      devices:               # Lists the self IP addresses and translations for each device. When creating a new GTM server, this value is required. This list is a complex list that specifies a number of keys. The `name' key
                               specifies a name for the device. The device name must be unique per server. This key is required. The `address' key contains an IP address, or list of IP addresses, for
                               the destination server. This key is required. The `translation' key contains an IP address to translate the `address' value above to. This key is optional. Specifying
                               duplicate `name' fields is a supported means of providing device addresses. In this scenario, the addresses will be assigned to the `name''s list of addresses.
      iquery_options:        # Specifies whether the Global Traffic Manager uses this BIG-IP system to conduct a variety of probes before delegating traffic to it.
      link_discovery:        # Specifies whether the system auto-discovers the links for this server. When creating a new GTM server, if this parameter is not specified, the default value `disabled' is used. If you set this
                               parameter to `enabled' or `enabled-no-delete', you must also ensure that the `virtual_server_discovery' parameter is also set to `enabled' or `enabled-no-delete'.
      name:                  # (required) The name of the server.
      partition:             # Device partition to manage resources on.
      password:              # (required) The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
      provider:              # A dict object containing connection details.
      server:                # (required) The BIG-IP host. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.
      server_port:           # The BIG-IP server port. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
      server_type:           # Specifies the server type. The server type determines the metrics that the system can collect from the server. When creating a new GTM server, the default value `bigip' is used.
      state:                 # The server state. If `absent', an attempt to delete the server will be made. This will only succeed if this server is not in use by a virtual server. `present' creates the server and enables it. If
                               `enabled', enable the server if it exists. If `disabled', create the server if needed, and set state to `disabled'.
      user:                  # (required) The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.
      validate_certs:        # If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable
                               `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
      virtual_server_discovery:   # Specifies whether the system auto-discovers the virtual servers for this server. When creating a new GTM server, if this parameter is not specified, the default value `disabled' is used.
