  bigip_policy_rule:
      actions:               # The actions that you want the policy rule to perform. The available attributes vary by the action, however, each action requires that a `type' be specified. These conditions can be specified in any
                               order. Despite them being a list, the BIG-IP does not treat their order as anything special.
      conditions:            # A list of attributes that describe the condition. See suboptions for details on how to construct each list entry. The ordering of this list is important, the module will ensure the order is kept when
