- name: Manages BIG-IP SNMP data collecting agent (DCA) monitors
  bigip_monitor_snmp_dca:
      agent_type:            # Specifies the SNMP agent running on the monitored server. When creating a new monitor, the default is `UCD' (UC-Davis).
      community:             # Specifies the community name that the system must use to authenticate with the host server through SNMP. When creating a new monitor, the default value is `public'. Note that this value is case
                               sensitive.
      cpu_coefficient:       # Specifies the coefficient that the system uses to calculate the weight of the CPU threshold in the dynamic ratio load balancing algorithm. When creating a new monitor, the default is `1.5'.
      cpu_threshold:         # Specifies the maximum acceptable CPU usage on the target server. When creating a new monitor, the default is `80' percent.
      description:           # Specifies descriptive text that identifies the monitor.
      disk_coefficient:      # Specifies the coefficient that the system uses to calculate the weight of the disk threshold in the dynamic ratio load balancing algorithm. When creating a new monitor, the default is `2.0'.
      disk_threshold:        # Specifies the maximum acceptable disk usage on the target server. When creating a new monitor, the default is `90' percent.
      interval:              # Specifies, in seconds, the frequency at which the system issues the monitor check when either the resource is down or the status of the resource is unknown. When creating a new monitor, the default is
                               `10'.
      memory_coefficient:    # Specifies the coefficient that the system uses to calculate the weight of the memory threshold in the dynamic ratio load balancing algorithm. When creating a new monitor, the default is `1.0'.
      memory_threshold:      # Specifies the maximum acceptable memory usage on the target server. When creating a new monitor, the default is `70' percent.
      name:                  # (required) Monitor name.
      parent:                # The parent template of this monitor template. Once this value has been set, it cannot be changed. By default, this value is the `snmp_dca' parent on the `Common' partition.
      partition:             # Device partition to manage resources on.
      password:              # (required) The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
      provider:              # A dict object containing connection details.
      server:                # (required) The BIG-IP host. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.
      server_port:           # The BIG-IP server port. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
      state:                 # When `present', ensures that the monitor exists. When `absent', ensures the monitor is removed.
      time_until_up:         # Specifies the number of seconds to wait after a resource first responds correctly to the monitor before setting the resource to 'up'. During the interval, all responses from the resource must be
                               correct. When the interval expires, the resource is marked 'up'. A value of 0, means that the resource is marked up immediately upon receipt of the first correct
                               response. When creating a new monitor, the default is `0'.
      timeout:               # Specifies the number of seconds the target has in which to respond to the monitor request. When creating a new monitor, the default is `30' seconds. If the target responds within the set time period,
                               it is considered 'up'. If the target does not respond within the set time period, it is considered 'down'. When this value is set to 0 (zero), the system uses the
                               interval from the parent monitor. Note that `timeout' and `time_until_up' combine to control when a resource is set to up.
      user:                  # (required) The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.
      validate_certs:        # If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable
                               `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
      version:               # Specifies the version of SNMP that the host server uses. When creating a new monitor, the default is `v1'. When `v1', specifies that the host server uses SNMP version 1. When `v2c', specifies that the
                               host server uses SNMP version 2c.
