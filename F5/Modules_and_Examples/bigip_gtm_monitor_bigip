      aggregate_dynamic_ratios:   # Specifies how the system combines the module values to create the proportion (score) for the load balancing operation. The score represents the module's estimated capacity for handing traffic.
                               Averaged values are appropriate for downstream Web Accelerator or Application Security Manager virtual servers. When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not
                               specified, the default of `none' is used, meaning that the system does not use the scores in the load balancing operation. When `none', specifies that the monitor
                               ignores the nodes and pool member scores. When `average-nodes', specifies that the system averages the dynamic ratios on the nodes associated with the monitor's target
                               virtual servers and returns that average as the virtual servers' score. When `sum-nodes', specifies that the system adds together the scores of the nodes associated with
                               the monitor's target virtual servers and uses that value in the load balancing operation. When `average-members', specifies that the system averages the dynamic ratios
                               on the pool members associated with the monitor's target virtual servers and returns that average as the virtual servers' score. When `sum-members', specifies that the
                               system adds together the scores of the pool members associated with the monitor's target virtual servers and uses that value in the load balancing operation.
      ignore_down_response:   # Specifies that the monitor allows more than one probe attempt per interval. When `yes', specifies that the monitor ignores down responses for the duration of the monitor timeout. Once the monitor
                               timeout is reached without the system receiving an up response, the system marks the object down. When `no', specifies that the monitor immediately marks an object down
                               when it receives a down response. When creating a new monitor, if this parameter is not provided, then the default value will be `no'.
      interval:              # Specifies, in seconds, the frequency at which the system issues the monitor check when either the resource is down or the status of the resource is unknown. When creating a new monitor, if this
                               parameter is not provided, then the default value will be `30'. This value *must* be less than the `timeout' value.
      ip:                    # IP address part of the IP/port definition. If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value will be '*'.
      name:                  # (required) Monitor name.
      parent:                # The parent template of this monitor template. Once this value has been set, it cannot be changed. By default, this value is the `bigip' parent on the `Common' partition.
      partition:             # Device partition to manage resources on.
      password:              # (required) The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
      port:                  # Port address part of the IP/port definition. If this parameter is not provided when creating a new monitor, then the default value will be '*'. Note that if specifying an IP address, a value between 1
                               and 65535 must be specified
      provider:              # A dict object containing connection details.
      server:                # (required) The BIG-IP host. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.
      server_port:           # The BIG-IP server port. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
      state:                 # When `present', ensures that the monitor exists. When `absent', ensures the monitor is removed.
      timeout:               # Specifies the number of seconds the target has in which to respond to the monitor request. If the target responds within the set time period, it is considered up. If the target does not respond within
                               the set time period, it is considered down. When this value is set to 0 (zero), the system uses the interval from the parent monitor. When creating a new monitor, if
                               this parameter is not provided, then the default value will be `90'.
      user:                  # (required) The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.
      validate_certs:        # If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable
                               `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
