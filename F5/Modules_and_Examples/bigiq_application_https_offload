  bigiq_application_https_offload:
      add_analytics:         # Collects statistics of the BIG-IP that the application is deployed to. This parameter is only relevant when specifying a `service_environment' which is a BIG-IP; not an SSG.

      description:           # Description of the application.
      inbound_virtual:       # Settings to configure the virtual which will receive the inbound connection. This virtual will be used to host the HTTPS endpoint of the application. Traffic destined to the `redirect_virtual' will be
                               offloaded to this parameter to ensure that proper redirection from insecure, to secure, occurs.
      name:                  # (required) Name of the new application.
      password:              # (required) The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
      provider:              # A dict object containing connection details.
      redirect_virtual:      # Settings to configure the virtual which will receive the connection to be redirected. This virtual will be used to host the HTTP endpoint of the application. Traffic destined to this parameter will be
                               offloaded to the `inbound_virtual' parameter to ensure that proper redirection from insecure, to secure, occurs.
      server:                # (required) The BIG-IP host. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.
      server_port:           # The BIG-IP server port. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
      servers:               # A list of servers that the application is hosted on. If you are familiar with other BIG-IP setting, you might also refer to this list as the list of pool members. When creating a new application, at
                               least one server is required.
      service_environment:   # Specifies the name of service environment or the hostname of the BIG-IP that the application will be deployed to. When creating a new application, this parameter is required.
      state:                 # The state of the resource on the system. When `present', guarantees that the resource exists with the provided attributes. When `absent', removes the resource from the system.
      user:                  # (required) The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.
      validate_certs:        # If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable
