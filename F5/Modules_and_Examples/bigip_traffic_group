- name: Manages traffic groups on BIG-IP
  bigip_traffic_group:
      mac_address:           # Specifies the floating Media Access Control (MAC) address associated with the floating IP addresses defined for a traffic group. Primarily, a MAC masquerade address minimizes ARP communications or
                               dropped packets as a result of failover. A MAC masquerade address ensures that any traffic destined for a specific traffic group reaches an available device after
                               failover, which happens because along with the traffic group, the MAC masquerade address floats to the available device. Without a MAC masquerade address, the sending
                               host must learn the MAC address for a newly-active device, either by sending an ARP request or by relying on the gratuitous ARP from the newly-active device. To unset
                               the MAC address, specify an empty value (`""') to this parameter.
      name:                  # (required) The name of the traffic group.
      partition:             # Device partition to manage resources on.
      password:              # (required) The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
      provider:              # A dict object containing connection details.
      server:                # (required) The BIG-IP host. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.
      server_port:           # The BIG-IP server port. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
      state:                 # When `present', ensures that the traffic group exists. When `absent', ensures the traffic group is removed.
      user:                  # (required) The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.
      validate_certs:        # If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable
                               `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
