      description:           # Specifies descriptive text that identifies the route domain.
      flow_eviction_policy:   # The eviction policy to use with this route domain. Apply an eviction policy to provide customized responses to flow overflows and slow flows on the route domain.
      id:                    # The unique identifying integer representing the route domain. This field is required when creating a new route domain. In version 2.5, this value is no longer used to reference a route domain when
                               making modifications to it (for instance during update and delete operations). Instead, the `name' parameter is used. In version 2.6, the `name' value will become a
                               required parameter.
      name:                  # The name of the route domain.

      password:              # (required) The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
      provider:              # A dict object containing connection details.
      routing_protocol:      # Dynamic routing protocols for the system to use in the route domain.
      server:                # (required) The BIG-IP host. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.

      state:                 # Whether the route domain should exist or not.
      strict:                # Specifies whether the system enforces cross-routing restrictions or not.
      user:                  # (required) The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.
      validate_certs:        # If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable
