  bigip_profile_persistence_src_addr:
      entry_timeout:         # Specifies the duration of the persistence entries. When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile. To specify an indefinite timeout, use
                               the value `indefinite'. If specifying a numeric timeout, the value must be between `1' and `4294967295'.
      hash_algorithm:        # Specifies the algorithm the system uses for hash persistence load balancing. The hash result is the input for the algorithm. When `default', specifies that the system uses the index of pool members to
                               obtain the hash result for the input to the algorithm. When `carp', specifies that the system uses the Cache Array Routing Protocol (CARP) to obtain the hash result for
                               the input to the algorithm. When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
      match_across_pools:    # When `yes', specifies that the system can use any pool that contains this persistence record. When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent
                               profile.
      match_across_services:   # When `yes', specifies that all persistent connections from a client IP address that go to the same virtual IP address also go to the same node. When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not
                               specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
      match_across_virtuals:   # When `yes', specifies that all persistent connections from the same client IP address go to the same node. When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by
                               the parent profile.
      name:                  # (required) Specifies the name of the profile.
      override_connection_limit:   # When `yes', specifies that the system allows you to specify that pool member connection limits will be overridden for persisted clients. Per-virtual connection limits remain hard limits and are not
                               overridden.
      parent:                # Specifies the profile from which this profile inherits settings. When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is the system-supplied `source_addr' profile.
      partition:             # Device partition to manage resources on.
      password:              # (required) The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
      provider:              # A dict object containing connection details.
      server:                # (required) The BIG-IP host. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.
      server_port:           # The BIG-IP server port. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
      state:                 # When `present', ensures that the profile exists. When `absent', ensures the profile is removed.
      user:                  # (required) The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.
      validate_certs:        # If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable
                               `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
