- name: Manages SNMP communities on a BIG-IP.
  bigip_snmp_community:
      access:                # Specifies the user's access level to the MIB. When creating a new community, if this parameter is not specified, the default is `ro'. When `ro', specifies that the user can view the MIB, but cannot
                               modify the MIB. When `rw', specifies that the user can view and modify the MIB.
      community:             # Specifies the community string (password) for access to the MIB. This parameter is only relevant when `version' is `v1', or `v2c'. If `version' is something else, this parameter is ignored.
      ip_version:            # Specifies whether the record applies to IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. When creating a new community, if this value is not specified, the default of `4' will be used. This parameter is only relevant when
                               `version' is `v1', or `v2c'. If `version' is something else, this parameter is ignored.
      name:                  # Name that identifies the SNMP community. When `version' is `v1' or `v2c', this parameter is required. The name `public' is a reserved name on the BIG-IP. This module handles that name differently than
                               others. Functionally, you should not see a difference however.
      oid:                   # Specifies the object identifier (OID) for the record. When `version' is `v3', this parameter is required. When `version' is either `v1' or `v2c', if this value is specified, then `source' must not be
                               set to `all'.
      partition:             # Device partition to manage resources on.
      password:              # (required) The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
      port:                  # Specifies the port for the trap destination. This parameter is only relevant when `version' is `v1', or `v2c'. If `version' is something else, this parameter is ignored.
      provider:              # A dict object containing connection details.
      server:                # (required) The BIG-IP host. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.
      server_port:           # The BIG-IP server port. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
      snmp_auth_password:    # Specifies the password for the user. When creating a new SNMP `v3' community, this parameter is required. This value must be at least 8 characters long.
      snmp_auth_protocol:    # Specifies the authentication method for the user. When `md5', specifies that the system uses the MD5 algorithm to authenticate the user. When `sha', specifies that the secure hash algorithm (SHA) to
                               authenticate the user. When `none', specifies that user does not require authentication. When creating a new SNMP `v3' community, if this parameter is not specified, the
                               default of `sha' will be used.
      snmp_privacy_password:   # Specifies the password for the user. When creating a new SNMP `v3' community, this parameter is required. This value must be at least 8 characters long.
      snmp_privacy_protocol:   # Specifies the encryption protocol. When `aes', specifies that the system encrypts the user information using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). When `des', specifies that the system encrypts the user
                               information using DES (Data Encryption Standard). When `none', specifies that the system does not encrypt the user information. When creating a new SNMP `v3' community,
                               if this parameter is not specified, the default of `aes' will be used.
      snmp_username:         # Specifies the name of the user for whom you want to grant access to the SNMP v3 MIB. This parameter is only relevant when `version' is `v3'. If `version' is something else, this parameter is ignored.
                               When creating a new SNMP `v3' community, this parameter is required. This parameter cannot be changed once it has been set.
      source:                # Specifies the source address for access to the MIB. This parameter can accept a value of `all'. If this parameter is not specified, the value `all' is used. This parameter is only relevant when
                               `version' is `v1', or `v2c'. If `version' is something else, this parameter is ignored. If `source' is set to `all', then it is not possible to specify an `oid'. This
                               will raise an error. This parameter should be provided when `state' is `absent', so that the correct community is removed. To remove the `public' SNMP community that
                               comes with a BIG-IP, this parameter should be set to `default'.
      state:                 # When `present', ensures that the address list and entries exists. When `absent', ensures the address list is removed.
      update_password:       # `always' will allow to update passwords if the user chooses to do so. `on_create' will only set the password for newly created resources.
      user:                  # (required) The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.
      validate_certs:        # If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable
                               `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
      version:               # Specifies to which Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) version the trap destination applies.
