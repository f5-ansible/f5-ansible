  bigip_config:
      merge_content:         # Loads the specified configuration that you want to merge into the running configuration. This is equivalent to using the `tmsh' command `load sys config from-terminal merge'. If you need to read
                               configuration from a file or template, use Ansible's `file' or `template' lookup plugins respectively.
      password:              # (required) The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
      provider:              # A dict object containing connection details.
      reset:                 # Loads the default configuration on the device. If this option is specified, the default configuration will be loaded before any commands or other provided configuration is run.
      save:                  # The `save' argument instructs the module to save the running-config to startup-config. This operation is performed after any changes are made to the current running config. If no changes are made, the
                               configuration is still saved to the startup config. This option will always cause the module to return changed.
      server:                # (required) The BIG-IP host. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.
      server_port:           # The BIG-IP server port. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
      user:                  # (required) The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.
      validate_certs:        # If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable
                               `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
      verify:                # Validates the specified configuration to see whether they are valid to replace the running configuration. The running configuration will not be changed. When this parameter is set to `yes', no change
                               will be reported by the module.
