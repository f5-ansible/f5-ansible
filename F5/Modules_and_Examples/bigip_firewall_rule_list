- name: Manage AFM security firewall policies on a BIG-IP
  bigip_firewall_rule_list:
      description:           # The description to attach to the policy. This parameter is only supported on versions of BIG-IP >= 12.1.0. On earlier versions it will simply be ignored.
      name:                  # (required) The name of the policy to create.
      partition:             # Device partition to manage resources on.
      password:              # (required) The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
      provider:              # A dict object containing connection details.
      rules:                 # Specifies a list of rules that you want associated with this policy. The order of this list is the order they will be evaluated by BIG-IP. If the specified rules do not exist (for example when
                               creating a new policy) then they will be created. Rules specified here, if they do not exist, will be created with "default deny" behavior. It is expected that you
                               follow-up this module with the actual configuration for these rules. The `bigip_firewall_rule' module can be used to also create, as well as edit, existing and new
                               rules.
      server:                # (required) The BIG-IP host. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.
      server_port:           # The BIG-IP server port. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
      state:                 # When `state' is `present', ensures that the rule list exists. When `state' is `absent', ensures that the rule list is removed.
      user:                  # (required) The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.
      validate_certs:        # If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable
                               `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
