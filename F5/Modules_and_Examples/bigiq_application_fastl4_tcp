                               least one server is required.
      service_environment:   # Specifies the name of service environment that the application will be deployed to. When creating a new application, this parameter is required. The service environment type will be discovered by this
                               module automatically. Therefore, it is crucial that you maintain unique names for items in the different service environment types. SSGs are not supported for this type
