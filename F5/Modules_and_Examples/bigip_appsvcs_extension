  bigip_appsvcs_extension:
      content:               # (required) Declaration of tenants configured on the system. This parameter is most often used along with the `file' or `template' lookup plugins. Refer to the examples section for correct usage. For
                               anything advanced or with formatting consider using the `template' lookup. This can additionally be used for specifying application service configurations directly in
                               YAML, however that is not an encouraged practice and, if used at all, should only be used for the absolute smallest of configurations to prevent your Playbooks from
                               becoming too large. If you `content' includes encrypted values (such as ciphertexts, passphrases, etc), the returned `changed' value will always be true.
      force:                 # Force updates a declaration. This parameter should be used in cases where your declaration includes items that are encrypted or in cases (such as WAF Policies) where you want a large reload to take
                               place.
      password:              # (required) The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
      provider:              # A dict object containing connection details.
      server:                # (required) The BIG-IP host. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.
      server_port:           # The BIG-IP server port. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
      state:                 # When `state' is `present', ensures the configuration exists. When `state' is `absent', ensures that the configuration is removed.
      tenants:               # A list of tenants that you want to remove. This parameter is only relevant when `state' is `absent'. It will be ignored when `state' is `present'. A value of `all' will remove all tenants. Tenants can
                               be specified as a list as well to remove only specific tenants.
      user:                  # (required) The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.
      validate_certs:        # If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable
                               `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
