- name: Manages device IP configuration settings for HA on a BIG-IP
  bigip_device_connectivity:
      cluster_mirroring:     # Specifies whether mirroring occurs within the same cluster or between different clusters on a multi-bladed system. This parameter is only supported on platforms that have multiple blades, such as
                               Viprion hardware. It is not supported on VE.
      config_sync_ip:        # Local IP address that the system uses for ConfigSync operations.
      failover_multicast:    # When `yes', ensures that the Failover Multicast configuration is enabled and if no further multicast configuration is provided, ensures that `multicast_interface', `multicast_address' and
                               `multicast_port' are the defaults specified in each option's description. When `no', ensures that Failover Multicast configuration is disabled.
      mirror_primary_address:   # Specifies the primary IP address for the system to use to mirror connections.
      mirror_secondary_address:   # Specifies the secondary IP address for the system to use to mirror connections.
      multicast_address:     # IP address for the system to send multicast messages associated with failover. When `failover_multicast' is `yes' and this option is not provided, a default of `224.0.0.245' will be used.
      multicast_interface:   # Interface over which the system sends multicast messages associated with failover. When `failover_multicast' is `yes' and this option is not provided, a default of `eth0' will be used.
      multicast_port:        # Port for the system to send multicast messages associated with failover. When `failover_multicast' is `yes' and this option is not provided, a default of `62960' will be used. This value must be
                               between 0 and 65535.
      password:              # (required) The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
      provider:              # A dict object containing connection details.
      server:                # (required) The BIG-IP host. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.
      server_port:           # The BIG-IP server port. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
      unicast_failover:      # Desired addresses to use for failover operations. Options `address' and `port' are supported with dictionary structure where `address' is the local IP address that the system uses for failover
                               operations. Port specifies the port that the system uses for failover operations. If `port' is not specified, the default value `1026' will be used.  If you are
                               specifying the (recommended) management IP address, use 'management-ip' in the address field.
      user:                  # (required) The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.
      validate_certs:        # If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable
                               `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
