- name: Manage DNS profiles on a BIG-IP
  bigip_profile_dns:
      cache_name:            # Specifies the user-created cache that the system uses to cache DNS responses. When you select a cache for the system to use, you must also set `enable_dns_cache' to `yes'
      enable_cache:          # Specifies whether the system caches DNS responses. When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile. When `yes', the BIG-IP system caches
                               DNS responses handled by the virtual servers associated with this profile. When you enable this setting, you must also specify a value for `cache_name'. When `no', the
                               BIG-IP system does not cache DNS responses handled by the virtual servers associated with this profile. However, the profile retains the association with the DNS cache
                               in the `cache_name' parameter. Disable this setting when you want to debug the system.
      enable_dns_express:    # Specifies whether the DNS Express engine is enabled. When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile. The DNS Express engine receives
                               zone transfers from the authoritative DNS server for the zone. If the `enable_zone_transfer' setting is also `yes' on this profile, the DNS Express engine also responds
                               to zone transfer requests made by the nameservers configured as zone transfer clients for the DNS Express zone.
      enable_dns_firewall:   # Specifies whether DNS firewall capability is enabled. When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
      enable_dnssec:         # Specifies whether the system signs responses with DNSSEC keys and replies to DNSSEC specific queries (e.g., DNSKEY query type). When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the
                               default is provided by the parent profile.
      enable_gtm:            # Specifies whether the system uses Global Traffic Manager to manage the response. When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
      enable_zone_transfer:   # Specifies whether the system answers zone transfer requests for a DNS zone created on the system. When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent
                               profile. The `enable_dns_express' and `enable_zone_transfer' settings on a DNS profile affect how the system responds to zone transfer requests. When the
                               `enable_dns_express' and `enable_zone_transfer' settings are both `yes', if a zone transfer request matches a DNS Express zone, then DNS Express answers the request.
                               When the `enable_dns_express' setting is `no' and the `enable_zone_transfer' setting is `yes', the BIG-IP system processes zone transfer requests based on the last
                               action and answers the request from local BIND or a pool member.
      name:                  # (required) Specifies the name of the DNS profile.
      parent:                # Specifies the profile from which this profile inherits settings. When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is the system-supplied `dns' profile.
      partition:             # Device partition to manage resources on.
      password:              # (required) The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
      process_recursion_desired:   # Specifies whether to process client-side DNS packets with Recursion Desired set in the header. When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent
                               profile. If set to `no', processing of the packet is subject to the unhandled-query-action option.
      provider:              # A dict object containing connection details.
      server:                # (required) The BIG-IP host. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.
      server_port:           # The BIG-IP server port. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
      state:                 # When `present', ensures that the profile exists. When `absent', ensures the profile is removed.
      unhandled_query_action:   # Specifies the action to take when a query does not match a Wide IP or a DNS Express Zone. When `allow', the BIG-IP system forwards queries to a DNS server or pool member. If a pool is not associated
                               with a listener and the Use BIND Server on BIG-IP setting is set to Enabled, requests are forwarded to the local BIND server. When `drop', the BIG-IP system does not
                               respond to the query. When `reject', the BIG-IP system returns the query with the REFUSED return code. When `hint', the BIG-IP system returns the query with a list of
                               root name servers. When `no-error', the BIG-IP system returns the query with the NOERROR return code. When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified,
                               the default is provided by the parent profile.
      use_local_bind:        # Specifies whether the system forwards non-wide IP queries to the local BIND server on the BIG-IP system. For best performance, disable this setting when using a DNS cache. When creating a new profile,
                               if this parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
      user:                  # (required) The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.
      validate_certs:        # If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable
                               `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
