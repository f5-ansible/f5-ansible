- name: Manage system authentication on a BIG-IP
  bigip_device_auth:
      authentication:        # Specifies the process the system employs when sending authentication requests. When `use-first-server', specifies that the system sends authentication attempts to only the first server in the list.
                               When `use-all-servers', specifies that the system sends an authentication request to each server until authentication succeeds, or until the system has sent a request to
                               all servers in the list. This parameter is supported by the `tacacs' type.
      password:              # (required) The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
      protocol_name:         # Specifies the protocol associated with the value specified in `service_name', which is a subset of the associated service being used for client authorization or system accounting. Note that the
                               majority of TACACS+ implementations are of protocol type `ip', so try that first.
      provider:              # A dict object containing connection details.
      secret:                # Secret key used to encrypt and decrypt packets sent or received from the server. *Do not* use the pound/hash sign in the secret for TACACS+ servers. When configuring TACACS+ auth for the first time,
                               this value is required.
      server:                # (required) The BIG-IP host. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.
      server_port:           # The BIG-IP server port. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
      servers:               # Specifies a list of the IPv4 addresses for servers using the Terminal Access Controller Access System (TACACS)+ protocol with which the system communicates to obtain authorization data. For each
                               address, an alternate TCP port number may be optionally specified by specifying the `port' key. If no port number is specified, the default port `49163' is used. This
                               parameter is supported by the `tacacs' type.
      service_name:          # Specifies the name of the service that the user is requesting to be authorized to use. Identifying what the user is asking to be authorized for, enables the TACACS+ server to behave differently for
                               different types of authorization requests. When configuring this form of system authentication, this setting is required. Note that the majority of TACACS+
                               implementations are of service type `ppp', so try that first.
      state:                 # The state of the authentication configuration on the system. When `present', guarantees that the system is configured for the specified `type'. When `absent', sets the system auth source back to
                               `local'.
      type:                  # The authentication type to manage with this module. Take special note that the parameters supported by this module will vary depending on the `type' that you are configuring. This module only supports
                               a subset, at this time, of the total available auth types.
      update_secret:         # `always' will allow to update secrets if the user chooses to do so. `on_create' will only set the secret when a `use_auth_source' is `yes' and TACACS+ is not currently the auth source.
      use_for_auth:          # Specifies whether or not this auth source is put in use on the system.
      user:                  # (required) The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.
      validate_certs:        # If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable
                               `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
