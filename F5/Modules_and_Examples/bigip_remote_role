- name: Manage remote roles on a BIG-IP
  bigip_remote_role:
      assigned_role:         # Specifies the authorization (level of access) for the account. When creating a new remote role, if this parameter is not provided, the default is `none'. The `partition_access' parameter controls
                               which partitions the account can access. The chosen role may affect the partitions that one is allowed to specify. Specifically, roles such as `administrator', `auditor'
                               and `resource-administrator' required a `partition_access' of `all'. A set of pre-existing roles ship with the system. They are `none', `guest', `operator',
                               `application-editor', `manager', `certificate-manager', `irule-manager', `user-manager', `resource-administrator', `auditor', `administrator', `firewall-manager'.
      attribute_string:      # Specifies the user account attributes saved in the group, in the format `cn=, ou=, dc='. When creating a new remote role, this parameter is required.
      line_order:            # Specifies the order of the line in the file `/config/bigip/auth/remoterole'. The LDAP and Active Directory servers read this file line by line. The order of the information is important; therefore, F5
                               recommends that you set the first line at 1000. This allows you, in the future, to insert lines before the first line. When creating a new remote role, this parameter is
                               required.
      name:                  # (required) Specifies the name of the remote role.
      partition_access:      # Specifies the accessible partitions for the account. This parameter supports the reserved names `all' and `Common', as well as specific partitions a user may access. Users who have access to a
                               partition can operate on objects in that partition, as determined by the permissions conferred by the user's `assigned_role'. When creating a new remote role, if this
                               parameter is not specified, the default is `all'.
      password:              # (required) The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
      provider:              # A dict object containing connection details.
      remote_access:         # Enables or disables remote access for the specified group of remotely authenticated users. When creating a new remote role, if this parameter is not specified, the default is `yes'.
      server:                # (required) The BIG-IP host. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.
      server_port:           # The BIG-IP server port. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
      state:                 # When `present', guarantees that the remote role exists. When `absent', removes the remote role from the system.
      terminal_access:       # Specifies terminal-based accessibility for remote accounts not already explicitly assigned a user role. Common values for this include `tmsh' and `none', however custom values may also be specified.
                               When creating a new remote role, if this parameter is not specified, the default is `none'.
      user:                  # (required) The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.
      validate_certs:        # If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable
                               `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
