- name: Manages licenses in a BIG-IQ registration key pool
  bigiq_regkey_license:
      accept_eula:           # A key that signifies that you accept the F5 EULA for this license. A copy of the EULA can be found here https://askf5.f5.com/csp/article/K12902 This is required when `state' is `present'.
      description:           # Description of the license.
      license_key:           # (required) The license key to put in the pool.
      password:              # (required) The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
      provider:              # A dict object containing connection details.
      regkey_pool:           # (required) The registration key pool that you want to place the license in. You must be mindful to name your registration pools unique names. While BIG-IQ does not require this, this module does. If
                               you do not do this, the behavior of the module is undefined and you may end up putting licenses in the wrong registration key pool.
      server:                # (required) The BIG-IP host. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.
      server_port:           # The BIG-IP server port. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
      state:                 # The state of the regkey license in the pool on the system. When `present', guarantees that the license exists in the pool. When `absent', removes the license from the pool.
      user:                  # (required) The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.
      validate_certs:        # If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable
                               `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
