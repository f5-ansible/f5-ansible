- name: Manages client SSL profiles on a BIG-IP
  bigip_profile_client_ssl:
      allow_non_ssl:         # Enables or disables acceptance of non-SSL connections. When creating a new profile, the setting is provided by the parent profile.
      cert_key_chain:        # One or more certificates and keys to associate with the SSL profile. This option is always a list. The keys in the list dictate the details of the client/key/chain combination. Note that BIG-IPs can
                               only have one of each type of each certificate/key type. This means that you can only have one RSA, one DSA, and one ECDSA per profile. If you attempt to assign two RSA,
                               DSA, or ECDSA certificate/key combo, the device will reject this. This list is a complex list that specifies a number of keys.
      ciphers:               # Specifies the list of ciphers that the system supports. When creating a new profile, the default cipher list is provided by the parent profile.
      name:                  # (required) Specifies the name of the profile.
      options:               # Options that the system uses for SSL processing in the form of a list. When creating a new profile, the list is provided by the parent profile. When a `''' or `none' value is provided all options for
                               SSL processing are disabled.
      parent:                # The parent template of this monitor template. Once this value has been set, it cannot be changed. By default, this value is the `clientssl' parent on the `Common' partition.
      partition:             # Device partition to manage resources on.
      password:              # (required) The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
      provider:              # A dict object containing connection details.
      secure_renegotiation:   # Specifies the method of secure renegotiations for SSL connections. When creating a new profile, the setting is provided by the parent profile. When `request' is set the ssystem request secure
                               renegotation of SSL connections. `require' is a default setting and when set the system permits initial SSL handshakes from clients but terminates renegotiations from
                               unpatched clients. The `require-strict' setting the system requires strict renegotiation of SSL connections. In this mode the system refuses connections to insecure
                               servers, and terminates existing SSL connections to insecure servers.
      server:                # (required) The BIG-IP host. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.
      server_port:           # The BIG-IP server port. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
      state:                 # When `present', ensures that the profile exists. When `absent', ensures the profile is removed.
      user:                  # (required) The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.
      validate_certs:        # If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable
                               `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
