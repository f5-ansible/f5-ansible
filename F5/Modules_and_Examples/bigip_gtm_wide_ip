      irules:                # List of rules to be applied. If you want to remove all existing iRules, specify a single empty value; `""'. See the documentation for an example.
      name:                  # (required) Wide IP name. This name must be formatted as a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). You can also use the alias `wide_ip' but this is deprecated and will be removed in a future Ansible
                               version.

      password:              # (required) The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
      pool_lb_method:        # (required) Specifies the load balancing method used to select a pool in this wide IP. This setting is relevant only when multiple pools are configured for a wide IP. The `round_robin' value is
                               deprecated and will be removed in Ansible 2.9. The `global_availability' value is deprecated and will be removed in Ansible 2.9.
      pools:                 # The pools that you want associated with the Wide IP. If `ratio' is not provided when creating a new Wide IP, it will default to 1.
      provider:              # A dict object containing connection details.
      server:                # (required) The BIG-IP host. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.

      state:                 # When `present' or `enabled', ensures that the Wide IP exists and is enabled. When `absent', ensures that the Wide IP has been removed. When `disabled', ensures that the Wide IP exists and is disabled.
      type:                  # Specifies the type of wide IP. GTM wide IPs need to be keyed by query type in addition to name, since pool members need different attributes depending on the response RDATA they are meant to supply.
                               This value is required if you are using BIG-IP versions >= 12.0.0.

                               `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
