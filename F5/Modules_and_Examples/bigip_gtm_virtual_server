- name: Manages F5 BIG-IP GTM virtual servers
  bigip_gtm_virtual_server:
      address:               # Specifies the IP Address of the virtual server. When creating a new GTM virtual server, this parameter is required.
      availability_requirements:   # Specifies, if you activate more than one health monitor, the number of health monitors that must receive successful responses in order for the link to be considered available.
      limits:                # Specifies resource thresholds or limit requirements at the server level. When you enable one or more limit settings, the system then uses that data to take servers in and out of service. You can
                               define limits for any or all of the limit settings. However, when a server does not meet the resource threshold limit requirement, the system marks the entire server as
                               unavailable and directs load-balancing traffic to another resource. The limit settings available depend on the type of server.
      link:                  # Specifies a link to assign to the server or virtual server.
      monitors:              # Specifies the health monitors that the system currently uses to monitor this resource. When `availability_requirements.type' is `require', you may only have a single monitor in the `monitors' list.
      name:                  # Specifies the name of the virtual server.
      partition:             # Device partition to manage resources on.
      password:              # (required) The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
      port:                  # Specifies the service port number for the virtual server or pool member. For example, the HTTP service is typically port 80. To specify all ports, use an `*'. When creating a new GTM virtual server,
                               if this parameter is not specified, a default of `*' will be used.
      provider:              # A dict object containing connection details.
      server:                # (required) The BIG-IP host. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.
      server_name:           # Specifies the name of the server that the virtual server is associated with.
      server_port:           # The BIG-IP server port. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
      state:                 # When `present', ensures that the resource exists. When `absent', ensures the resource is removed.
      translation_address:   # Specifies the translation IP address for the virtual server. To unset this parameter, provide an empty string (`""') as a value. When creating a new GTM virtual server, if this parameter is not
                               specified, a default of `::' will be used.
      translation_port:      # Specifies the translation port number or service name for the virtual server. To specify all ports, use an `*'. When creating a new GTM virtual server, if this parameter is not specified, a default of
                               `*' will be used.
      user:                  # (required) The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.
      validate_certs:        # If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable
                               `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
      virtual_server_dependencies:   # Specifies the virtual servers on which the current virtual server depends. If any of the specified servers are unavailable, the current virtual server is also listed as unavailable.
