  bigip_snmp_trap:
      community:             # Specifies the community name for the trap destination.
      destination:           # Specifies the address for the trap destination. This can be either an IP address or a hostname.
      name:                  # (required) Name of the SNMP configuration endpoint.
      network:               # Specifies the name of the trap network. This option is not supported in versions of BIG-IP < 12.1.0. If used on versions < 12.1.0, it will simply be ignored. The value `default' was removed in BIG-IP
                               version 13.1.0. Specifying this value when configuring a BIG-IP will cause the module to stop and report an error. The usual remedy is to choose one of the other
                               options, such as `management'.
      partition:             # Device partition to manage resources on.
      password:              # (required) The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
      port:                  # Specifies the port for the trap destination.
      provider:              # A dict object containing connection details.
      server:                # (required) The BIG-IP host. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.
      server_port:           # The BIG-IP server port. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
      snmp_version:          # Specifies to which Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) version the trap destination applies.
      state:                 # When `present', ensures that the resource exists. When `absent', ensures that the resource does not exist.
      user:                  # (required) The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.
      validate_certs:        # If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable
                               `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
