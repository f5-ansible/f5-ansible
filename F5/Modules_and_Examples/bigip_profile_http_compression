  bigip_profile_http_compression:
      buffer_size:           # Maximum number of compressed bytes that the system buffers before inserting a Content-Length header (which specifies the compressed size) into the response. When creating a new profile, if this
                               parameter is not specified, the default is provided by the parent profile.
      description:           # Description of the HTTP compression profile.
      gzip_level:            # Specifies the degree to which the system compresses the content. Higher compression levels cause the compression process to be slower. Valid values are between 1 (least compression and fastest) to 9
                               (most compression and slowest).
      gzip_memory_level:     # Number of kilobytes of memory that the system uses for internal compression buffers when compressing a server response.
      gzip_window_size:      # Number of kilobytes in the window size that the system uses when compressing a server response.
      name:                  # (required) Specifies the name of the compression profile.
      parent:                # Specifies the profile from which this profile inherits settings. When creating a new profile, if this parameter is not specified, the default is the system-supplied `httpcompression' profile.
      partition:             # Device partition to manage resources on.
      password:              # (required) The password for the user account used to connect to the BIG-IP. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_PASSWORD'.
      provider:              # A dict object containing connection details.
      server:                # (required) The BIG-IP host. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER'.
      server_port:           # The BIG-IP server port. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_SERVER_PORT'.
      state:                 # When `present', ensures that the profile exists. When `absent', ensures the profile is removed.
      user:                  # (required) The username to connect to the BIG-IP with. This user must have administrative privileges on the device. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable `F5_USER'.
      validate_certs:        # If `no', SSL certificates are not validated. Use this only on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates. You may omit this option by setting the environment variable
                               `F5_VALIDATE_CERTS'.
